# ZyraAI Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Model Architecture Enhancements (1-2 weeks)

1. **Add a Third Convolutional Layer** 
   - Implement a deeper architecture with a third convolutional block
   - Adjust dimensions throughout the network accordingly
   - Experiment with different filter configurations (64 filters in the third layer)
   Status: Done
   - Created mnist_enhanced_cnn.cpp with three convolutional layers (16->32->64 filters)
   - Added batch normalization and appropriate dimensionality changes
   - Implemented 50 epoch training with early stopping and learning rate scheduling

2. **Implement Residual Connections**
   - Create a ResidualBlock class that wraps the convolutional layers
   - Add skip connections to improve gradient flow
   - Experiment with different residual block configurations
   Status: Done
   - Created mnist_residual_network.cpp with three residual blocks
   - Utilized both ResidualBlock and SimpleResidualBlock implementations
   - Implemented different channel configurations (16->32->64) with skip connections

## Implementation Strategy

I recommend starting with the architectural enhancements since they're most straightforward to implement with our current codebase. Here's the immediate action plan:

1. Add the third convolutional layer and adjust the network dimensions
2. Implement a basic skip connection architecture
3. Begin exploring Metal framework integration
4. Add support for CIFAR-10 dataset
